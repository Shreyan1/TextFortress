# TextFortress
A Python Work on 3-Level Symmetric Encryption and Decryption System.

Hello Guys ! 

Welcome to (the project) TextFortress - a place to Fortify your texts !
You can encrypt and decrypt any .txt, .py, .java, .cpp, .julia file apart from RTF with 3-layer encryption system built from scratch using Encryption keys.

This project has a lot of potential and can be a go-to software for all Audio, image, and any kind of files that is available in the coming releases.
It is definitely a WIP and handling the entire thing by myself is a huge load as of now.

Feel free to collaborate on this project, I have made this as a public version of the existing one.
Also if anyone wants to take this project up/ acquire it, I'll be happy to help lead your team away.

Also feel free to drop a mail to shreyanbasuray@proton.me.

Also refer to my Visual architechture PDF file that I have attached here for the understanding of the code.
And for the demo refer to my LinkedIn post at - https://tinyurl.com/TextFortress

N.B - Although the Language percent is shown to be max for TEX and HTML, it is only so due to generating the .exe resulting in a bindle of dependencies.
Don't worry, it is coded in Python exclusively and a little bit of .bat
